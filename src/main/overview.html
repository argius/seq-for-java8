	<p>Seq-for-Java8 - the library of sequencial containers which is
		neither Collection nor Stream</p>

	<p>Sequences in this library are simple array wrappers.</p>

	<p>Features are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>immutable ArrayList (java.util.ArrayList)
		<li>some methods in Stream APIs.
		<li>primitive type supports (int, long, double)
		<li>Seq in Scala
	</ul>

	All of these Sequences are not scalable. If you need scalability, use
	Streams in java.util.stream package.
